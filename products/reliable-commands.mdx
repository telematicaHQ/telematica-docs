## Introduction
Telematica reliable commands is a feature that allows you to issue commands to a vehicle or device in a reliable and efficient manner. 

You can simply send the command to our system and "fire and forget" - we take care of the rest. 
This includes retrying the command if necessary, monitoring the progress of command execution, and performing sanity checks. 

Once the command has been successfully executed, we will send a webhook callback to inform you of the outcome. 
If the execution cannot be confirmed or if the command fails, we will still send you a callback with the relevant information. 


## Command States
Additionally, after issuing a command, you can query the state of execution of a command at any time.
Here are some verbose states you might see:

- "Sending command to vendor"
- "Command sent to vendor, waiting for vendor status API to reflect result"
- "Result confirmed"
- "Result cannot be confirmed in time"
- "Command failed due to following reason: {reason}"

You can find the full list of states and their encoding for in the documentation.
