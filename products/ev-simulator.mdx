We've built an EV simulator specifically to help you quickly test the use case that you are building in various scenarios without relying on a real vehicle.

 There are currently 4 types of EVs available:
 1. __Auto-updating simulated vehicle (driving & charging):__ 
 An EV that drives during the day time and charges overnight. 

2. __Auto-updating simulated vehicle (charging only):__ 
 An EV that is always being charged where you can also customize factors affecting the charging speed (EV battery size, State of Charge, Max. charging rate of EV, Max. charging rate of chargepoint, Environmental factor).

3. __Auto-updating simulated vehicle (drivig only):__ 
 An EV that is always driving where you customise the trip parameters like start, stop location, speed, climate control and occupancy.

4. __Customizable simulated vehicle:__
A custom EV, where you can set custom values for SoC, Range, Location, Odometer, and Charging status.
