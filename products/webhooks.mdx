If your use case requires monitoring vehicle's data for specific events, our webhook module is perfect for you.
You can create a webhook monitor for any data point, and we will notify you when the data point reaches the defined trigger.
 
 We get the data efficiently at optimal intervals in the background from user's vehicle, and send a webhook callback if all the defined conditions for the trigger are met.

Some sample use cases are:

1. Send a webhook callback request when the user starts / stops a charging session.
2. Send a webhook callback when the user's battery level reaches a given target
   while charging.
