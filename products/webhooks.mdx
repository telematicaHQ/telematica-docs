If your use case requires monitoring vehicle's data for specific events, our webhook module is perfect for you.
You can create a webhook monitor for any data point, and we will notify you when the data point reaches the defined trigger.

<br/> We get the data efficiently at optimal intervals in the background from user's vehicle, and send a webhook callback if all defined conditions for trigger are met.

Some sample use cases are:

1. Send a webhook callback request when user starts / stops a charging session.
2. Send a webhook callback when user's battery level reaches a given target
   while charging.
