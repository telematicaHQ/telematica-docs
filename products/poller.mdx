If your use case requires fetching vehicle's data at regular intervals, our poller module is perfect for you.
You can create a repeating GET job with custom frequency to poll your customer's EV data.

<br/> We get the data efficiently in the background from your vehicle and deliver it to your backend as POST request body.

Poller only allows you to read data from a vehicle. If you need to issue
commands based on a schedule, see
[Telematica Schedules](/products/schedules)

Some sample use cases are:

1. Monitor charge level during a charging session
2. Monitor range and location during a trip for EV routing
3. Record parking location every midnight for insurance underwriting
