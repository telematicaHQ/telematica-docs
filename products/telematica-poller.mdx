title: "Poller"
description: "Effortless polling of EV data"
---

Create a repeating job with custom frequency to poll your customer's EV data in
certain interval and get it delivered to your backend.

Poller only allows you to read data from a vehicle. If you need to issue
commands based on a schedule: see
[Telematica Schedules](/products/telematica-schedules-beta)

Some sample use cases are:

1. Monitor charge level during a charging session
2. Monitor range and location during a trip for EV routing
