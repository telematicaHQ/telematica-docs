### For Consumer apps
The Connect UI helps the EV driver (user) in granting access to their connected car data. 
Consider it similar to the "Sign in with Google" button, where they can also review the data and other control permissions requestedÂ by your service.
  
    This is an entirely customizable flow that you can personalise to your design theme and typography. 
    You can also choose to skip some pages(more about that [here](/guides/consent-ui-parameters))

### For Fleets
We have 2 types of sign in methods designed specifically for fleets:
1. Connect multiple EVs associated to a single account at once. 
For example, if a single account has 20 Teslas, you can select all 20 vehicles at once.
2. Bulk upload to connect multiple EVs from different brands by simply sharing a csv file with us.
