description: "Single API to read data and issue commands to 26+ EV brands"
---

Our unified API helps you to access live telematics and battery data as well as issue commands to control charging and lock/unlock the car across more than 26 different car brands.
As a result, you simply work with a single Telematica API without having to build or maintain connections with different OEMs ever again.

  __Accessible endpoints:__
  
  - SoC (Battery level)
  - Range
  - Odometer
  - Location
  - Make, model, variant, and year
  - Start and stop charging
  - Lock and unlock the car
 
 We are constantly trying to support more endpoints and OEMs and will continue to update this list.
