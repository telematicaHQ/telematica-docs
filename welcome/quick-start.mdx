## 🔧 Sandbox Access

### Get your developer keys and start using sandbox mode

In case you don't already have your app-id and secret, reach out to us on
[mail](mailto:aditya@telematica.so) to get one issued. You'll need to include
these credentials with all API calls.

Here's a sample of how app-id and secret will look like:

```json
{
  "app-id": "40a67cba-545f-495e-bade-73df342a80cd",
  "secret": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI0MGE2N2NiYS01NDVmLTQ5NWUtYmFkZS03M2RmMzQyYTgwY2QiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9.zyNHt_rNlcN0NlCkvTYHH0RYKaBn9I9lpFeYc85HXA0"
}
```

Once you have the API keys with you, you can start using the APIs in sandbox
mode right away, no action is needed from your side.

Sandbox mode will allow you to
[sign up with real vehicles](/reference/consent-ui-parameters), use our APIs to
get their data using [docs UI](/reference/vehicle-data-v2) and test out
end-to-end flow.

To use the sandbox mode, use the following link to connect a vehicle:

Text

```md
https://us.telematica.so/connect?app=<app-id>&user=<random_string>&region=<US,
EU or IN>
```

For more information on the above URL, see
[Consent UI and custom query parameters](/reference/consent-ui-parameters)

When you are ready to take Telematica APIs to production, move on to step 2

## Steps for production access (\<10 mins)

### Create a POST callback endpoint in you backend

When a user connects a vehicle to your application, Telematica will send
vehicle-id of authorized vehicles(s) through a POST webhook call to your
backend. You can store these `vehicleId`s' in your database and pair them with
users in your app.

[This guide](/reference/callback-endpoint) will walk you through all the steps
required from your end to make a callback endpoint:

### Embed the consent flow in your app

<Tip>
More about user consent

User data is accessible for your app via Telematica's EV APIs only after
explicit permission grant by user in form of OEM app credentials. This is a
one-time process from user's end, and they are entitled to opt out of
data-sharing agreement as per their wish.

</Tip>

Embed a web-view in your mobile app, pointing at the following URL:

```md
https://us.telematica.so/connect?app=<app-id>&user=<user_id_in_your_db>&region=<region>
```

where `region` is one of `US`, `EU` or `IN`.

You can customize the page for each instance using supported query parameters
found in the following page:

<Card
  title="Consent UI Guide"
  icon={regular("book-open")}
  href="/guides/consent-ui-parameters"
>
  Consent UI enable your users to securely provide consent to their EV data to
  you. You can use the following information to build a customised url and
  redirect your customer to it.
</Card>

<Tip>
**Skipping pages**

This flow is fully customizable as per your app's requirements. You can also
choose to skip directly to the OEM login screen if

1. You know the brand of vehicle beforehand and
2. You have already taken user's consent in your own app (includes accepting
   Telematica's privacy policy)

</Tip>

### Access vehicle data through our Vehicle APIs

Once the user has granted consent for your app to access their vehicle data, you
can use [ Vehicle Data APIs](/reference/vehicle-data-v2) to fetch vehicle data
from your backend.
