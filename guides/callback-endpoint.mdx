title: "Creating the POST callback endpoint"
---

## 1. Expose a POST endpoint in your backend

Expose a POST endpoint (preferable ending with `/telematica-callback`) in you
backend, which will receive callbacks.

<Warning>
**Enable CORS for the endpoint**

Don't forget to enable CORS for the endpoint to accept callback information.

</Warning>

## 2. Configure your backend

Configure your backend to save user-to-vehicle mapping in your database when a
POST call comes in from Telematica on the above endpoint.

You can expect the POST request body to follow this schema:

```json
{
  "user": "userid_in_your_database", // user-id in your database, passed as query-param in first step
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "vehicleId": "6ac03024a2b0fa158a16743f04fbbdd8", // vehicleId in Telematica's database
      "vin": "5YJ3E7EB1LFXXXXXX",
      "make": "TESLA", 
      "model":"Model 3",
      "year": 2021,
      "registration": "GJ02QB2457" // Vehicle registration (only for Indian vehicles)
    },
    {
      // Second vehicle, in case the user selected multiple vehicles to be paired
      "vehicleId": "4f360b8044a852bac0db3f12a7610adf",
      "vin": "3MW5P9J03N8CXXXXX",
      "make": "BMW",
      "model":"330e x-Drive",
      "year": 2021,
      "registration": "MP09AS1322"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Info>

**For EU and US regions**

The registration field will not be included in the callback for regions other
than India. You can call the
[/static-attributes](https://telematica.readme.io/reference/vehicledatacontroller_getstaticattributes) endpoint to get more info
about the vehicle once it's connected to your app.

## 3. Share the endpoint with Telematica

Share the endpoints you've created with us over
[Email](mailto:aditya@telematica.so).
Also share the authentication token for endpoint if you have any.

## FAQs

### Why is there a callback endpoint?

Once the end user logs in with their OEM credentials, we make a callback to your
backend to pass on the information to your backend.

The information shared includes `vehicleId` in our database, vehicle's
registration number and `userId` in your database to map it to.

### Sample POST request for testing

Here is a sample cURL request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://yourapp.com/api/telematica-callback' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer QOkDgC532UGa9pK3L0a' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "user": "6141ab3b216714547b09815f",
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "registration": "MP09AS3987",
      "id": "61fe4a188a4c4d1ef9ba0b62"
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Can I add an authentication token to the POST endpoint?

Sure. Please make sure your backend accepts the token in following header
format:

```bash
--header 'Authorization: Bearer QOkDgC532UGa9pK3L0a'
```

### Can I make different endpoints for different environments (`dev`, `stage`, `prod`) ?

Yes. Telematica will hit the `prod` endpoint by default if no special query
parameter is present.

To indicate Telematica to make callback on any other endpoint, please add a
`callbackUrl` parameter in the consent UI url :

```bash
https://us.telematica.so/connect?
  app=<app_id>&
  user=<user_id>&
  callbackUrl=https://dev.yourapp.com/api/telematica-callback
```
